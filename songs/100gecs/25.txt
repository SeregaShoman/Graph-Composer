[Intro]
G-g-g-g-gec

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
I fucking hate Twitter, I fucking hate it all
I wanna delete Instagram also
I fucking hate it all, I don't wanna go
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
I fucking hate Twitter, I fucking hate it all
I wanna delete Instagram also
I fucking hate it all, I don't wanna go

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Can't take it anymore
You live on the timeline, I just bought a Porsche
All this shit makes me feel crazy (Crazy)
Think I might go and text Jamie
I don't wanna hit another refresh
I just wanna reset
I don't need to see it
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
Fucking hate twitter, I fucking hate it all

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
I fucking hate Twitter, I fucking hate it all
I wanna delete Instagram also
I fucking hate it all, I don't wanna go



[Verse 2: Alice Gas]
Right now it makes me really sick how you conceive me
I tweet all that stupid shit and you believe me
They think that anywhere you are, I should be leaving
I got all this flying money I'm receiving
I'm tired of giving you all these fucking freebies
And if you're listening it feels kinda creepy
Feels like I live with my head inside of a TV
And I'm so sick and tired, yeah, it makes me sleepy

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
I fucking hate Twitter, I fucking hate it all
I wanna delete Instagram also
I fucking hate it all, I don't wanna go
Delete my fucking socials, I don't care anymore
I fucking hate Twitter, I fucking hate it all
I wanna delete Instagram also
I fucking hate it all, I don't wanna go

[Outro]
