[Intro: Laura Les]
A little box, a little house, a little tomb
I'm playing Minecraft in my motherfucking room
I put the weed into the bongs onto my mouth
I blow it out the window, I'll kick down my fucking house

[Verse: Laura Les]
Oh my God
What the fuck
Take the pack, crush it up
Take a bit, packs of shit
Light it up, take a whiff
Roll four, lookin' sick
Build a house, find a pig
I'm playing motherfucking Minecraft

[Chorus: Laura Les]
God, let me focus on my Minecraft
God, let me focus on my Minecraft
Hush up, let me focus on my Minecraft
I'm tryna play this motherfucking Minecraft

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
A little house, a little fish, a little pond
Playing Minecraft on my motherfucking phone
Don't tell me if its time for bed, you're fucking wrong
I'm playing Minecraft till the motherfucking morn'
I have diamonds and I'm precious
What they feel like, I'm so basic
Shiny sorta, walk for miles
My diamonds feed the fire


[Chorus: Laura Les]
God, let me focus on my Minecraft
God, let me focus on my Minecraft
Hush up, let me focus on my Minecraft
I'm tryna play this motherfucking Minecraft
