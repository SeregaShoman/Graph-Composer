[Intro: Laura Les]
And you were on me
Everything's boring
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me bleed?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Do you wanna torture me?

[Refrain: Laura Les]
And you were on me
Everything's boring
Everybody hurts sometimes, everything works sometimes
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Do you wanna torture me?

[Chorus: Laura Les]
And you were on me
Everything is boring
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me bleed?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Do you wanna torture me?
(Do you wanna torture me?)


[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
Oh, never felt this before, no

[Chorus: Laura Les]
And you were on me
Everything's boring
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me bleed?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Do you wanna torture me?

[Refrain: Laura Les]
And you were on me
Everything is boring
Everybody hurts sometimes, everything works sometimes
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna torture me?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Do you wanna torture me?
(Do you wanna torture me?)
