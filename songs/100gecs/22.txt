[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
I got problems with my spending
All these voices in my head
I'm doing eighty in a stolen car
Never in a hurry
Singing: "La-di-da-di-da-di-da
All I wanna do is smoke some trees"
Drinkin' bottles of Moscato
Takin' pictures with the models
Stayin' up until the morning
Wish that I was more deserving
Goin' wild like I'm [?]
Wishin' some bottles were less harmful, yeah


[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I exhale the blunt smoke, it sounds like a shotgun
I don't need a deal so I went out and I got one
Live in dog years and I feel 26
Yeah, I'm old bitch, but I learn new tricks
Like to throw hands like a ton of new bricks
Stay and smoke through trees that look like little sticks
Yeah, I smoke trees, little trees like dicks (hehehehe)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah


[Outro: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Let's go
Send it back, send it back, send it back, do it
And I go, and I hit, and I go, and I hit
Do it all
And I say "do it all", and I say "do it all"
All the way, do it all, all the way
Throw it back
Bring it home, all the way
And I go, and I go, and I go
And I stop, and I stop, and I stop
All the way, all the way, all the way
And I go, and I go, and I go on fire
