[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll take you to the mall
All alone, playin' tricks in your hall
How 'bout you pick out some new clothes
I want to take you to the mall

[Verse: Laura Les]
When's the last time we went to the mall?
I hope it was sooner than later
When's the next time we'll go to the mall?
I wanna buy you some Hot Topic Invader Zim merch
We can get Auntie Anne's, I think that sounds cool

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll take you to the mall
All alone, playin' tricks in your hall
How 'bout you pick out some new clothes (out some new clothes)
I want to take you to the mall
