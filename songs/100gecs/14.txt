[Intro: Dylan Brady]
G-g-g-g-g-gec
Back once again
A-a-and you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Anything about me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me
Me-me-me

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
When we were together, I tried to tell you
I used to tap dance and I was in choir
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed a go-kart
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy
And you're always busy, so you never hear me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me


[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?
I take it back quick and I nod like "true"
'Cause you say so many things, and I don't know what I mean
Short messages to you, short messages to me
Now if I think of a joke when I say goodbye
I put my palms on my face and pretend to cry
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you prob'ly think I'm so mean
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I guess it's such an easy game, ga-ga-game, ga-ga-game
If it put you right to sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Rationale, a cheap cliché, ché-ché-ché, ché-ché-ché
I wouldn't call that sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Could you explain it all away? (Way-way-way, way-way-way)
Like it was all so clean? (Cle-cle-clean, cle-cle-clean)
Something said about the, wait-
Okay bet, I forget
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll forget, it's cool
I guess I'll never know


[Chorus: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
Know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me

[Outro: Dylan Brady and Laura Les]
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me (Wooooh!)
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Yeah, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me
