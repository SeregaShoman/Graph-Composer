[Intro: Laura Les]
Dog food
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
,
Got a dead man chilling in a box

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Girl, are you down now?
Oh, yeah, I've been down for a time now
Got a bed, I've been dead for a while now
80 texts, haven't read for a while now
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Dog food
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Girl, are you down now?
Oh, yeah, I've been down for a time now
Got a bed, I've been dead for a while now
80 texts, haven't read for a while now
Oh, yeah
Am I down now?
Oh, yeah, I've been dead for a time now
I've been fed from my bed for a while now
If I fall out of bed would I die now?
Oh, yeah


[Chorus: Laura Les]
Dog food
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
Got a dead man chilling in a costume
Got a dead man chilling in a box
