[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
You're lookin' cute with that gap in your teeth
The jean jacket with the t-shirt underneath
You tell your boyfriend if he still got beef
That over time, it's gonna give him heart disease

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
So say cheese, take a picture for me
So say please, and you can take it for free
So say cheese, take a picture for me
So say please, and you can take it for free
(Lonely machines, yeah)

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I open my phone and you're in my DMs
Why do you think that it's cute to be creepy?
You call me "dude" and then ask mе to peg you
Burnt-out dude, you look like you'rе sixty
I don't know why you text me
I don't even look sexy
Plus, I'm fucking married

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
So Godspeed, take a picture for me
Lonely machines, they won't touch you for free
So Godspeed, take a picture for me
Lonely machines, yeah, they won't touch you for free


[Verse 3: Nathaniel Motte]
She's just the right type of twisted and sweet
Still got the light that she gifted to me, yeah
Show me the reasons and where I should go
Give up the freedoms of living alone

[Chorus: Sean Foreman]
So Godspeed, take a picture for me
Lonely machines, they won't touch you for free
So Godspeed, take a picture for me
Lonely machines, yeah, they won't touch you for free

[Outro: 3OH!3]
So fuck it up
All these catalyst converters are just bummers on the weekend
They just wait until they see your face and then adjust the preset
(Lonely machines)
All these new-agey converters are just boomers on the weekend
They just see your ugly face and then they turn around and pretend
(Lonely machines)
All these catalyst converters are just bummers on the weekend
They just wait until they see your face and then adjust the preset
(Lonely machines)
All these new-agey converters are just boomers on the weekend
They just see your ugly face and then they turn around and pretend
