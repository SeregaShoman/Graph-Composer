[Intro]
Pick it up

[Verse 1: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Wanted some speakers, Xbox, and t-shirts
I've been good like every single day
Looked under my tree, my box was empty
Santa made an enemy that day (What the fuck?)
Done being jolly, time to be naughty
Think it's time we settle up the score
Fill up the wishlist, let's cause some mischief
Grab my keys, I'm headin' out the door

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Laura Les]
I've been good for way too long
Gonna get the shit I want (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck


[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
He's watching TV, he doesn't see me
Go and get the bag out of his sleigh
Elves in the kitchen heard the ignition
Think it's time we make our getaway
Chains on the tires, he's right behind us
Screaming 'cause we stole his magic bag (Get back here)
Boots full of lead feet, gas in the Chevy
Hundred-fifty miles on the dash

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Laura Les]
I've been good for way too long
Gonna get the shit I want (Ah, ah)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck
Never gave me a goddamn thing that I want
I was good every day but he didn't give a fuck
This year, put the top on the back of the truck
Santa's banging on the back of the truck


[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
