[Verse 1]
She don't like it but I made her a believer
On my worst day, I still wouldn't wanna be her (Wouldn't wanna be her)
You think I give a fuck? I'm in the field, you in the bleachers (Huh?)
You gotta know your place, but you a student, I'm a teacher (Lil' bitch, yeah, woah)
We wild out (Let's go, let's go), spazzin'
Voila (Voila), magic
You want it, I got it, lil' bitch, I'm toxic
How you do that?
Goin' one-twenty, I might do the dash (Might do the dash)
I spend a lot 'cause I make it back fast (Make it back fast)
I'm higher than these bitches (Yeah), talkin' to me like I asked (Huh? What?)
He did the scam, now that boy think he got cash (Cash)
All I know is get them bands (Yeah)
Give a fuck 'bout makin' friends (Yeah), ayy, ayy
Don't care if I fall in the pit (Yeah)
I get up and do it again, ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be shy (Bitch, woo)
Let it out (Let it out)
If you wanna rage (If you wanna rage)
Let it out (Baby girl, just let it out, ayy, ayy)
Throw the fade (Throw the fade)
What you barkin' 'bout? (What the fuck these bitches barkin' 'bout?)
If you wanna bang (Huh? Huh?)
Then bang it out (Bitch)


[Chorus]
Let it out (Go), let it out
Let it out, let it out (Go, go, go, go)
Let it out, let it out (Woo)
Let it out (Yeah), let it out
Let it out (Let's go), let it out
Let it out, let it out (Ayy, let's go)
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out (Let's go)

[Verse 2]
If you wanna rage
Let it out (Just let it out)
Bitches throwin' shade (Woah)
Punch 'em in they mouth (Punch 'em in they mouth, let's go, let's go)
We don't make the rules (We don't make the rules, yeah)
We just break 'em all (We just break 'em all, fuck)
We'll fuck you up (Woah, woah)
We don't call the law (We don't talk the law), she said
I'm a asshole, what the fuck's new? (Haha, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If it's fuck me, then it's fuck you (Uh, okay, okay)
These bitches be trippin', we are not cool (Lil' bitch, what the fuck?)
Get the fuck out my way when I come through (Get the fuck out my way, get the fuck out my way, bitch)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be shy (Bitch, woo)
Let it out (Let it out)
If you wanna rage (If you wanna rage)
Let it out (Baby girl, just let it out, ayy, ayy)
Throw the fade (Throw the fade)
What you barkin' 'bout? (What the fuck these bitches barkin' 'bout?)
If you wanna bang (Huh? Huh?)
Then bang it out (Bitch)


[Chorus]
Let it out (Go), let it out
Let it out, let it out (Go, go, go, go)
Let it out, let it out (Woo)
Let it out (Yeah), let it out
Let it out (Let's go), let it out

Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out (Let's go)
