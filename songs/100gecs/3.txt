[Intro]
Pick it up!

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Bet my money on a stupid horse, I lost that
So I ran out to the track to get my cash back
I just gotta leave this place with a big bag
So I found the fuckin' jockey and I grabbed that (Pick it up!)
Pushed him down to the ground and I punched him in his face (In his face!)
Yeah, I stole his phone, that put him in his place (In his place!)
Me and the horse, we ran out of the place (Out the place!)
Then we drove my Porsche back to my place

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account

[Interlude]
Woo, pick it up!


[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Stupid horse and a swordfish dancer (Pick it up)
Spending my money on a fishnet carousel
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Racing horses at the derby
Why am I never getting lucky?
I never have any money
I never win any money

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Oh shit)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account, oh no (Oh no)
Stupid horse, I just fell out of the Porsche (Of the Porsche)
Lost the money in my bank account
