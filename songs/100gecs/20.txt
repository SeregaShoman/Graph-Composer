[Intro: Laura Les]
(Indiscernible lyrics)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Sitting around, don't know what you're doing now, but that's okay
Feeling now, got a phone, doing shit but I'm on the phone
Mad now, I'm smoking dope, god damn that's a whole lot of dope
Good shit, that's all I know

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up
I can't feel it now


[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Feeling now, don't know what I'm feeling now but that's okay
Doing shit on the phone, got a phone so that's okay
Phone is dead but I ain't dead but I'm talking to you so that's okay
God damn Matt, find my rope

[Chorus: Laura Les]
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel you
And how it feels to know, though
I can't give it up
How it feels to know, though
I can't feel it now
And how it feels to find out
I can't give it up, can't give it up

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Can't give it up
I can't give it up
I can't hear ya

[Verse 3: Dylan Brady]
Feeding now, got a doge, and a phone, so my dog's a phone
Eating now, on the floor, feeling like "Oh, that's okay"
Feeding doge my femur bone but my teeth break on the bone
Good shit, fuck teeth, okay, doggo
