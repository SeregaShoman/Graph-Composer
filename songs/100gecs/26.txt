[Intro: Dylan Brady]
Indiscernible lyrics

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
N-now no-now we back causing mischief
Hold it back, do you feel it?
See your face in the mirror
And your nails in the dresser
I-I I-I don't wanna read the letter
We don't have to talk, it's better
Sometimes I think you wanna kill me
Sometimes I don't know who I'm kidding

[Verse: Laura Les]
Look-look-look
I had to get a rhythm real quick
I'm taking pills that shorten my dick
Th-th-th-th-th-they're in my hand and in my tummy
We're smoking estradiol gummies
My ears are dripping blood onto the carpet
Open up the window, someone farted
Everybody's looking at me funny
Oh shit, I tri–µd to smoke my money
I'm pinching crumbs out of my pocket
I'm smoking weed that smells like dog shit
My phone is sitting on the table
Thank God, I thought I fucking lost it
I-I-I just bought an ounce for the weekend
Feels like I'm always fucking crying
I guess the devil's in the details
I guess its all about the timing
