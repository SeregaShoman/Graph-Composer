[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I-I-I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
It hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows (It shows)

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Do it big in the mine, like always
Do it big, gettin' diamonds like always
Grab my golden pick, and my golden axe
And my golden shovel, and my .40 mag
Everybody knows, I smoke the big weed
Everybody, get down, everybody, shut up
Everybody, this is my song
You can't believe what I put in my song

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe, you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
But it hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows


[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
It's been a month, haven't seen the sun in days (Days)
Thought you said, come to show somewhere (Somewhere)
I need you right there in the front row (Front row)
Singin' every bar at the (gec) show (Hey)
But-but-but I said that I need you
Need you all the time and you know I wanna see you
I'll sing a song to you (Yeah) at the next show
I wanna see you there, it's been so long

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can't say what it means that you came to my show
But it hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I-I-I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
It hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows
I can't believe you came to my show
It hurts when you don't, it hurts when you don't
I want to see you every day
It hurts and it shows, it hurts and it shows (It shows)
