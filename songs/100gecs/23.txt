[Chorus]
You were never dead to me
And bitterness is easier
You were never anything
You're alive and breathing in

[Verse]
You, me
Try to see
Why try so hard?
I still have dreams (I still have dreams)
With you alive and breathing in (With you alive and breathing in)
It's been so long (It's been so long)
It hurt so much, it's so hard

[Chorus]
You were never dead to me (You were never dead to me)
You're alive and breathing in (You're alivе and breathing in)
You, me
Try to see (You, me)
Why try so hard? (Try to see)

[Outro]
But it's cold
It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's cold
Why you gotta try so hard?
Why you gotta try so hard?
Feel so brokе inside
Reaching for anything I can find
But it's cold
It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's—
Why you gotta try so hard?
Why you gotta try so hard?
That's all
